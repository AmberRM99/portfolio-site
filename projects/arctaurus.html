                <b>THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE</b> – due to the risks involved with investing and trading and the strict laws surrounding such industries, while teaching people how to use the platform we could not encourage or recommend any strategies. For example, the obvious solution to explaining how to start building a strategy would be to walk them through it, however legal advice strongly discouraged this due to fears even showing what blocks to use could construe as endorsing a particular investment

                <b>BLOCKLY </b>– Due to the time already invested learning the Google Blockly platform for the softwares back end, I was instructed not to change from this client-side library. This presented many challenges, as the UI is tricky to customise especially with block shapes

        <div class="row">
            <p>ArcTaurus is a drag and drop no-code software, tailored to automated cryptocurrency trading. The interface consists of jigsaw puzzle-like pieces, which by connecting together, triggers the corresponding code.</p><br>
            <p> There are 4 puzzle shapes,
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-3 blocktypes">
                        set up - <img src="/images/arcTaurus/blocks/setup.svg" width="30%">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-3 blocktypes">
                        logic - <img src="/images/arcTaurus/blocks/thicker-web-blue.png" width="40%">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-3 blocktypes">
                        Boolean - <img src="/images/arcTaurus/blocks/boolean.svg" width="50%">

                </div>
                </p><br>
            <p> These 4 shapes represent 4 aspects considered core to programming. Setup holds all the code like a function, logic controls computer logic and decisions, boolean allows checks for if something is true or not, which then triggers logic, and number allows any value to be stored and referenced such as the price of a coin or an indicators value.<br>These blocks are stored in categories to the left hand side, split based on similar function.
            Each category contained blocks of the same purpose, for example logic blocks (for users to control decisions such as if this happens do that, or if this value is bigger than that value), or market events (which detected changes in the current market price).  
            </p>
            <p>Blocks then connect together to establish a logical trading strategy</p>

    <div class="row">
        Luckily, the application was already in beta testing and I was able to meet with the most prominent user of the software. On our first meeting, I conducted a straightforward UX Interview, where we sat with the product and openly discussed likes or dislikes without presenting anything he was already familiar with. Later as sketches and prototypes progressed, I was able to meet this same stakeholder to go over think alouds and observation studies to allow him to test the proposed solutions and see how accurately they aligned with his thoughts.

        Later as onboarding designs progressed we brought in a mix of technical and non-technical users to test the platform for the first time in a series of think aloud studies. They’d each be asked questions about their familiarity with different code and logic concepts, and there knowledge of crypto, to get a baseline of what was a usability issue and remove bias of people who likely would not use the service. This particular methodology was used to track the KPI Time til Value

       Because of the complex nature of reducing programming terms to blocks, card sorting was used to help link similar terms and build a foundation for categorisation. This was performed both internally with other developers, to ensure the coding aspects were correct, as well as with non-technical users to ensure they could find items during task walkthroughs.

                For onboarding a tutorial system was developed. This was split into 3 categories to cover 3 pain points – the first to explain how the Blockly UI, the second to explain the different categories of blocks, and a third to explain programming logic and some getting started ideas. The third section proved the most difficult due to the laws around financial advice, and the age old advice ‘show don’t tell’ was impossible to follow.

                After re-entering user testing with the proposed onboarding, it became clear the assumption that many users in the target demographics, particularly those already technically proficient, assume they do not need onboarding and that they are able to figure it out through trial and error, which the base system Blockly doesn’t easily lend itself to. This prompted the final version of the onboarding software, internally called ‘Hidden Onboarding’.

                <p>
                Hidden Onboarding relied on delivering the most critical skills and knowledge for the product in a simple quick way that didn't feel like learning. A smaller version of the blockly window was implemented in a pop up with some simple blocks that users were asked to assemble. This was shown when users local storage indicated it was their first time visiting the platform.

                <p>
                As some technical users missed aspects of real coding, so commentiing was added. Programmers add comments to document their work and remember what each part of it does, and this is still useful in no-code applicatons to remember how you built your system. This was added to ArcTaurus in the form of sticky notes, which could be attached to bots, as sticky notes seemed the correct hybrid for technical and non-techncal users, as well as for internal tools for teaching the product. They were also customisable as they could be collapsed, and drew their colours from common IDE colours, to allow colour coding notes.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:1.3rem;"> This design required unearthing the no longer supported Blockly core commenting system, and updating it to be functional and improving the aesthetics. As a result, it may later become part of Blockly as a plugin.</p>

                <p>
                To help users learn and improve their training, I built an accompanying wiki on all the bots and their uses. The copy was writen in collaboration with two professinal crypto traders to ensure accuracy, but readability. Each block on right click had a 'Help' option which linked to the wiki entry for it.
            </p>
            <p>The ui was designed to emulate the ArcTaurus bot builder with the categories along the side. Each section was also colour coded to match the category to help enforce pattern association.</p>

                To address the businesses needs, a Business to Business version of the product was also developed aimed at professional traders offering additional information. To solve how to incorporate so much extra information, I developed a new UI ‘Split Screen’. This offered clients additional services such as reading the code generated in alternative formats including one designed to mimic English, as well as outputting the blocks into a flowchart, connecting to a backtesting (dashboard) system, and exporting all data into a pdf.

                    <h4>New Feature - Split Screen</h4>
                <p>
                Split screen allowed me to hone in on the pain point of needing human centric error messages, and a kinder way to understand when and why a bot isn’t working. An error checking system was built into each block, which generated a list of all problems, from empty input, missing data and inappropriate logic. 
            </p>

                <div class="col-md-4">

                    <p>The new Error system adds a clickable warning icon to any blocks that contain missing inputs. It also adds warning to the setup block if the bot contains improper logic. Clicking the icons, or saving an errored bot, display the error page in split screen. Each error is listed like a console, featuring a clickable bullet point to highlight the problem visually in the code. </p>
                <p>
                The addition of the Split Screen UI, particularly it’s Error handling system, saw a remarkable improvement in bot building time in novice and non-technical users. Based on user interviews, key findings where it ‘Improved trust in the bot’ by validating there were no logical errors, and ‘Helped discovering new strategies and ways to build’ by allowing more trial and experimentation when building.

                    <h4>Improvement - Recommender System</h4>
                <p>
                To make building bots easier and quicker, as well as improve discovery time for blocks, there was a recommendation system in place that when clicking on an input, it opened a list of all available blocks. I pushed this system further, by redesigning the icons to be more recognisable, and writing code to automatically place a block selected from this list into the input. This drastically reduced bot building time, as well as overcoming the accessibility hurdle of the difficult click and drag motion. It also inspired users more confidence to try different blocks, as they could intuitively see where they connecct.

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <div class="row importantQuote">
            <p> This project taught me to trust my intuition as a designer and UX professional. For example, in discovery the element I deemed most important to the projects success was error handling. I planned to use this as an accompaniment to onboarding, to encourage self-correction and provide an opportunity for users to learn from mistakes rather than risking failure and exiting the software. However, this feature fell down the priority list due to the business assumption onboarding was key to reducing user errors occuring at all. Once the error handling was added, it addressed an array of pain points in a simple, yet effective, implementation.
                <br><br> ArcTaurus also taught me how to be a front end developer, something I had never done prior to this project. It forced me to build on my best practice knowledge for prototypes and wireframes but also how to implement it myself. It held myself accountable, that what I designed also had to be buildable within the project scope, and has given me a better understanding of the limitations and opportunities of transforming prototypes to code.<br><br>I believe this project would have been more successful with a larger team and the accompaniement of a senior front-end developer to help alleviate my workload, however I remain proud of what I built under the circumstances.</p>
