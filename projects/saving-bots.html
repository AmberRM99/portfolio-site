                            <p> One of the questions set out to answer as part of this speculative project was should the service be tailored to be used by online banking users, or should it be a service used in bank branches where an employee helps customers build strategies.</p>
                            <p>Based on the initial research, it was clear there was an interest in this product as an online banking feature for personal use, thus the goal became to simplify it enough that anyone could use it. It can then be re-expanded should it be utilised instead as an in-branch service.</p>

                            <p> Blockly is not mobile friendly, however should the product be released for online banking, this issue had to be addressed.  An alternative version of the UI was developed for a mobile experience. This differed from simply having a responsive product, as unfortunately some aspects of the blockly core functionality did not respond well to resizing. Instead it offered two different views based on screen size. Alongside this, various prototypes of how this system could fit into the existing online banking ecosystem were explored. <br><br>The alternative was also considered that if need be, the mobile view would present an image and details of the strategy, with editing access restricted based on screen size. </p>

                                <p> A challenge presented was Variables. Programming variables, named objects whoâs value and contents can change over time, are essential to code, but incredibly difficult to convey to non-programmers. Variables were essential to this projects success, as we needed a way for users to input personal details unique to them and allow them to use those figures</p>

                                <p>  To address the issue, I developed a "my details" section, where users can sit and input all details required from account numbers, bill payment dates, through to saving goals and contact information. Each value inputted on this system would generate a new block option matching the name set in the panel. This allowed users to program their own variables without every knowing what it was. </p>

                            <p>While, unfortunately, Finance Builder was never picked up for further development by Natwest, it was a valuable learning opportunity in fintech. It taught me a lot about incorporating established brand guidelines to maintain a look and atmosphere they have spent time building. It also allowed me more time to focus on UX design basics and ensure I had a solid wireframe and base system before expanding into nice-to-have features.

                               <br><br> This project also allowed me to develop my empathy skills in UX. As the product's scope could cover the entire general public, it allowed me time to dig deep into different aspects of financial struggle, identify pain points people may not even realise they have, and generate a wide array of solutions. Persona-led problem-solving was crucial for this project's success and is a tool I will incorporate in future projects where applicable.
